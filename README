THIS PROJECT IS NOT OFFICIAL PROCON DEVELOPMENT!

This is attempt to convert existing popular games admin console (for Battlefield - Bad Company 2, Battlefield 3)
from Procon written in C# to Java. Aim of this conversion is provided multiple application target options such as:
- stand alone GUI
- web application with web container that can be easily deploy on any existing clan/club/community server
- Android application (presumably just limited functionality of above options such as enforcing server rules,
  monitoring players behaviour {language, players abuse, team-killing, baseraping }, map change, making space for member)
